========

This module provides functionality for generating price paths
using a **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** process. The underlying 
asset price \(S_t\) is assumed to follow a GBM, which ensures 
positive prices and normally distributed log return.

The function `generate_gbm_paths` below implements this update for
multiple independent paths.

    """Generate price paths following a geometric Brownian motion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    S0 : float
        Initial asset price at time zero.
    mu : float
        Annualized drift of the underlying asset (expected return).
    sigma : float
        Annualized volatility of the underlying asset.
    dt : float
        Time step size in years (e.g. 1/365 for daily steps).
    steps : int
        Number of time steps to simulate (not counting the initial point).
    n_paths : int
        Number of independent price paths to simulate.
    seed : int, optional
        Random seed to ensure reproducibility.  If ``None`` no seeding is
        performed.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        A twoâ€‘dimensional array of shape ``(n_paths, steps+1)``.  Each row
        represents a simulated price path, with the first column equal to
        ``S0``.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation uses vectorized operations for efficiency.
